Created a custom checkout step with knockout and  HTMl. 
It provides a functinality to the user that he can select the listed vendor from where he wants to pick the order. 
I have implemented the Google Map api's On the step so user can serach for vendors near to there shipping address.  
User can choose the distance too user can also serach using the vendor name.
